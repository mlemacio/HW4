# HW4
All questions must use hashmaps. All solutions should run in the most efficient time possible.

## Documentation
Hashmaps here: https://github.com/CS196Illinois/Lecture-Notes/blob/master/hashmaps.md <\n>
Arrays here: https://github.com/CS196Illinois/Lecture-Notes/blob/master/python_LoopsAndArrays.md <\n>

## Testing
"python hw4_test.py" to run test cases.

## Notes
This weeks homework is not as difficult as last weeks, however, we are checking for runtime. Most of these problems can be performed without a hashmap. Make sure your solutions run in the most optimal runtime (by employing a dictionary) and also have good style.

## Bugs
As always, ping staff if you find a bug in the homework!
